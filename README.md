# Rithp: a tiny Scheme interpreter

This is a Ruby implementation of a tiny subset of Scheme, loosely targeting
R5RS.  There are lots of other similar projects out there, all of which are
better written than this one.  This one is just me teaching myself new things.

I have never written a language parser or interpreter before, and I'm not using
a textbook or structured tutorial, so be warned: **I have no idea what I'm
doing**. I'm having fun, though!
